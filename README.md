# PyTips
Every programming language has tips that if you pay attention to it, you can produce better programs. Python is no exception. There are lots of lists for Python tips. In this repository, I list the items I came across at work. This list also includes cases in which (new) Python programmers make mistakes.

## Tips list:
- **0x00** - [The Zen of Python](https://github.com/gtavasoli/PyTips/blob/master/Notebooks/The-Zen-of-Python.ipynb)
- **0x01** - [Shallow and Deep Copy](https://github.com/gtavasoli/PyTips/blob/master/Notebooks/Shallow-and-Deep-Copy.ipynb)
- **0x02** - [Arguments and Unpacking](https://github.com/gtavasoli/PyTips/blob/master/Notebooks/Arguments-and-Unpacking.ipynb)
- **0x03** - [Iterators and Generators](https://github.com/gtavasoli/PyTips/blob/master/Notebooks/Iterator-and-Generator.ipynb)
